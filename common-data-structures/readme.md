# Built-in data structures

In JavaScript, built-in data structures like Array, String, Object, Set, WeakSet, Map, and WeakMap can be used to implement the more complex data structures and algorithms. Here’s how these native data structures can be used:

## Arrays

Array is a versatile data structure that can be used to implement various other data structures:

- Stack: Using push and pop for LIFO.
- Queue: Using push for enqueue and shift for dequeue.

## Strings

Strings can be used for manipulating and storing text data. They can also be used in algorithms like:

- Substring search: Implementing algorithms like KMP or Rabin-Karp.
- String Reversal: Using JavaScript’s built-in methods.

## Objects

Objects are used to create hash maps or dictionaries:

- Hash Map: Using key-value pairs for fast lookup

## Set

Sets can be used to store unique values and perform set operations:

- Unique Collection: Storing unique items.
- Set Operations: Intersection, Union, Difference.

## WeakSet

WeakSets are useful for storing objects while allowing garbage collection:

- Garbage Collection: Keeping track of objects without preventing garbage collection.

## Map

Maps provide a more flexible key-value store compared to objects:

- Hash Map: Using objects as keys.

## WeakMap

WeakMaps are used to store objects as keys while allowing garbage collection:

- Garbage Collection: Keeping track of objects without preventing garbage collection.

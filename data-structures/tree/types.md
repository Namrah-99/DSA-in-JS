# Types

## Directed Tree (or Arborescence):
- Definition: A tree where each edge has a direction, and there is exactly one path from the root to any other node.
- Differentiation: Defines a hierarchy or flow direction from the root to the leaves.

## Undirected Tree:
- Definition: A tree where each edge is bidirectional, and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.
- Differentiation: Represents a structure without any inherent directionality, often used in modeling relationships.

## Full Tree:
- Definition: A tree where every node has either zero or the maximum number of children (for a binary tree, every node has either 0 or 2 children).
- Differentiation: Maximally fills each level of the tree with nodes.

## Complete Tree:
- Definition: A tree where all levels except possibly the last are fully filled, and the last level is filled from left to right.
- Differentiation: Ensures minimal height for the number of nodes, often used in binary heaps.

## Perfect Tree:
- Definition: A tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- Differentiation: Balances the tree fully, ensuring maximum efficiency for operations like searching and sorting.

## Balanced Tree:
- Definition: A tree where the heights of the two subtrees of every node differ by at most one.
- Differentiation: Optimizes operations to ensure they remain efficient even with dynamic data.

## Directed Tree (Arborescence):
- Edge Direction: Each edge in a directed tree has a specific direction, typically from one node (parent) to another (child).
- Connectivity: There is exactly one path from the root node to any other node.
- Usage: Directed trees are useful in scenarios where directionality matters, such as hierarchical structures or flow networks.

## Undirected Tree:
- Edge Symmetry: Edges in an undirected tree are bidirectional, meaning they do not have a specific direction and can be traversed in both directions.
- Connectivity: There is exactly one path between any pair of nodes.
- Usage: Undirected trees are commonly used to represent relationships or networks where the connection between nodes is symmetric and directionality is irrelevant.

## Key Differences Summarized:
- Edge Direction: Directed trees have directed edges, while undirected trees have bidirectional edges.
- Connectivity: Directed trees have a defined root node and a directional flow, whereas undirected trees have equal connectivity in both directions between any pair of nodes.
- Usage: Directed trees are suited for hierarchical or flow-based structures, while undirected trees are used for symmetric relationships or networks.

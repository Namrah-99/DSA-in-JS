# Linked List Types and Variations

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Circular Doubly Linked List
- Header Linked List
- Unrolled Linked List
- Skip List
- Self-Organizing List
- XOR Linked List

## Singly Linked List
A linked list where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Traversal is unidirectional.

## Doubly Linked List
A linked list where each node contains a data element, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. Traversal can be done in both directions.

## Circular Linked List
A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be singly or doubly linked.

## Circular Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list where the last node's next reference points to the first node, and the first node's previous reference points to the last node. Traversal can be done in both directions and is circular.

## Header Linked List
A linked list that contains a special node (header) at the beginning. This header node does not hold any meaningful data and is used for simplifying list operations.

## Unrolled Linked List
A linked list variant where each node stores an array of elements, reducing the overhead of pointers and improving cache performance.

## Skip List
A linked list with multiple layers, where each layer allows skipping over multiple nodes, enabling faster search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Self-Organizing List
A linked list that reorders its elements based on access patterns, such as Move-to-Front, Transpose, and Count methods.

## XOR Linked List
A memory-efficient doubly linked list where each node stores the XOR of the addresses of the previous and next nodes.


## Linked List Applications
- Implementing stacks and queues using linked lists.
- Using linked lists to handle collisions in hash tables.
- Representing graphs using linked lists.
- Allocating and deallocating memory dynamically.

# Factors that determine the time complexity:

### Constant Time Operations (O(1)): 
If the method performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the size of the input, it has constant time complexity. For example:
```javascript
obj.methodName = function() {
    return this.property; // Assuming accessing `property` is O(1)
}
```
### Linear Time Operations (O(n)): 
If the method iterates over an array or a list of length n, it has linear time complexity. For example:
```javascript
obj.methodName = function(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log(arr[i]);
    }
}
```
### Quadratic Time Operations (O(n^2)): 
If the method contains nested loops that iterate over an array or list, it may have quadratic time complexity. For example:
```javascript
obj.methodName = function(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
}
```
### Logarithmic Time Operations (O(log n)): 
If the method involves operations that reduce the problem size by a factor of two (e.g., binary search), it has logarithmic time complexity. For example:
```javascript
obj.methodName = function(arr, target) {
    let left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Other Complexities: 
Depending on the operations performed, the method can have other complexities like O(n log n), O(n^3), etc.

To determine the exact time complexity of obj.methodName(), you would need to analyze the code inside methodName. If you provide the code of the method, I can help you determine its time complexity.

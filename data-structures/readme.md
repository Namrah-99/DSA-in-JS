## Fundamental Data Structures

### Arrays

Fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

### Linked Lists

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### Stacks

LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.

### Queues

- FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.
- Priority Queue
- Deque (Double-ended Queue)

## Trees and Graphs

### Binary Trees

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black Tree)
- B-Trees and B+ Trees
- Heaps (Max Heap, Min Heap)

### Graphs

- Directed and Undirected Graphs
- Weighted and Unweighted Graphs
- Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List representations

## Hashing

### Hash Tables

- Direct Addressing Table
- Hash Map
- Hash Set

## Specialized Trees

### Tries

Prefix Trees, often used for search auto-completion and spell checking.

### Suffix Trees

Used for string matching problems.

## Advanced Data Structures

### Segment Trees

Used for answering range queries.

### Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)

Used for efficient update and prefix sum queries.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

Used for dynamic connectivity.

### Sparse Tables

Used for range queries on immutable data.

## Miscellaneous

### Matrix

2D arrays, used for representing grids and matrices.

### Bloom Filters

Probabilistic data structure for membership testing.

### Skip Lists

Alternative to balanced trees, used in databases and file systems.

### Self-balancing Binary Search Trees

- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees

### Ternary Search Trees

Used for storing strings, similar to Tries.

### Suffix Arrays

Space-efficient alternative to suffix trees.

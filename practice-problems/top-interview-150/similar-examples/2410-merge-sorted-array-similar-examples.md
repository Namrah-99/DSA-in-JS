# 2410. Maximum Matching of Players with Trainers

## Leetcode Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description/

## Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a `greedy approach` and `two-pointers approach` along with `sorting`. The idea is to match players with trainers in such a way that we maximize the number of matches by always trying to pair the smallest available player ability with the smallest available trainer capacity that can accommodate that player. Hereâ€™s how we can do it step-by-step:

## Approach
#### 1. Sort both arrays:
  - Sort the `players` array in ascending order of abilities.
  - Sort the `trainers` array in ascending order of training capacities.
#### 2. Use two pointers:
  - Initialize two pointers, one for the `players` array (`i`) and one for the `trainers` array (`j`), both starting at 0.
  - Iterate through both arrays and try to match the current player with the current trainer.
#### 3. Greedy Matching:
  - If the current player's ability is less than or equal to the current trainer's capacity, it means we can match them. Increment both pointers and increase the match count.
  - If the current player's ability is greater than the current trainer's capacity, increment the trainer pointer to find a suitable trainer.
#### 4. End of Iteration:
  - The iteration ends when we have gone through either all players or all trainers.
  - The count of matches will give the maximum number of matchings possible.

## Solution Code
```javascript
var matchPlayersAndTrainers = function(players, trainers) {
    // Sort both arrays
    players.sort((a,b)=> a-b);
    trainers.sort((a,b)=> a-b);
    // Pointers for players and trainers
    let i=0,j=0; let matches = 0;

    // Use two pointers to find the maximum number of matchings
    while(i<players.length && j<trainers.length){
        if(players[i] <= trainers[j]){
            matches++; // Match found
            i++; // Move o next player
            j++; // Move to next trainer
        }else{
            // Trainer cannot accommodate the player, so move to next trainer 
            j++;
        }
    }
    // Return maximum number of matchings between players and trainers 
    return matches
};

// Example Usage
let players1 = [4, 7, 9];
let trainers1 = [8, 2, 5, 8];
console.log(matchPlayersAndTrainers(players1, trainers1)); // Output: 2

let players2 = [1, 1, 1];
let trainers2 = [10];
console.log(matchPlayersAndTrainers(players2, trainers2)); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting both arrays takes O(nlogn) time.
- The two-pointer iteration through both arrays takes O(n) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(nlogn)`.
